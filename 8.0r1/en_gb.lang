By closely following my guide, you will quickly and efficiently learn about each of the mods involved in what is quickly becoming known as one of the most immersive, complete, and intricately detailed modpacks out in the MC community today!  %n%nThe difficulty of each quest will determine the reward(s) you receive - the more difficult the quest, the better the reward! In my modpack, most of the recipes have been changed in order to make you use utilize your creativity, inventiveness, and ingenuity to make for yourself (and perhaps your teammates) the resources and processes needed to complete your goal. I have done my best to design this modpack to not only be challenging for expert players, but also be carefully balanced and crafted to be appealing (and hopefully not too overwhelming) for MC modpack beginners as well.%n%n§r§f§e§b§oI have also designed into DDSS a very special reward system where you will earn coins (from the Thermal Expansion mod) while completing quests and exploring your world. You can use these coins to buy items in the Questbook Shop or use them to create (RF/FE) power later on as you progress.%n%nOverview:%n%n§7§6T1- Copper Coins    %n§8§4§3§2§1§9§b§d§e§e§fT2- Silver Coins %n§6§eT3- Gold Coins %n§3T4- Platinum Coins%n§6§6§8§9§a§9§9§a§b§c§d§d§e§f§c§dT5- Lumium Coins %n§2§f§a§a§2T6- Enderium Coins
